    	    Title:The Oxen & the Wheels   
    	</div>
		A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. They had to use all their strength to
		<br>
		pull the wagon, but they did not complain.

        The Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of
        <br>
        the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through
        <br>
        the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work 
        <br>
        so much the harder to endure.
        <br>
        "Silence!" the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. "What have you Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing
        <br>
        all the weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides."
