	    Title:A Raven & a Swan
	</div>
		A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest 
		<br>
		snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and
		<br>
		plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the Swan's.
		<br>
        So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed
        <br>
        and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate
        <br>
        did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.
