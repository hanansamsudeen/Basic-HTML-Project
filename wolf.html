	    Title:The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
	</div>
	A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the 
	<br>
	Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The
	<br>
	next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a
	<br>
	little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
    That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the
    <br>
    Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to
    <br>
    the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.
