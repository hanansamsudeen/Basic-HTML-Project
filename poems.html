	        Title:Belling The Cat
	    </div>
	    The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, 
		<br>
		the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they
		<br>
		might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such 
		<br>
		constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.
        <br>
        Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a 
        <br>
        very young Mouse got up and said:
        <br>
        "I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.
        <br>
        All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell
        <br>
        ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming."
        <br>
        All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. 
        <br>

        But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:
        <br>
        "I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one 
        <br>
        question: Who will bell the Cat?"
        <br>
        <hr>
        Moral:It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.
