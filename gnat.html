	   The Gnat & the Bull 
	</div>
		A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on 
		<br>
		the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly
		<br>
		away. But before he left he begged the Bull's pardon for having used his horn for a resting
		<br>
		place.
        <br>
        "You must be very glad to have me go now," he said.
        <br>
        "It's all the same to me," replied the Bull. "I did not even know you were there."

        Moral:We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.
